Terminal Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

1. Live cells with fewer than 2 live neighbors die (underpopulation)
2. Live cells with 2 or 3 neighbors survive
3. Live cells with more than 3 live neighbors die (overpopulation)
4. Dead cells with exactly 3 live neighbors become alive (reproduction)
